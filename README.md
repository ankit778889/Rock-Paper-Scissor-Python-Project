# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Python-Project
## Objective: 
Create a Python program that simulates the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.

## Features:

Allow the player to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
Simulate the computer's choice randomly.
Determine the winner based on the game rules:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats Rock
Keep track of the score and allow the player to play multiple rounds.

## Functions:

get_user_choice(): Prompts the user to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and validates the input.
get_computer_choice(): Randomly selects the computer's choice from the options.
determine_winner(user_choice, computer_choice): Compares the user's and computer's choices to determine the winner based on the game rules.
play_game(): Controls the flow of the game, allowing the user to play multiple rounds until they decide to stop.

## Main program:

Starts the game by calling play_game() function.
Manages the score tracking and asks the user if they want to play again after each round

## Usage:

Run the script.
Enter your choice of rock, paper, or scissors when prompted.
The computer randomly selects its choice.
The winner for each round is determined based on the game rules.
The score is displayed after each round, and the player can choose to play again.
